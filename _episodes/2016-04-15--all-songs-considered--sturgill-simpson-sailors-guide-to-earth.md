title:         "Sturgill Simpson talks about \"A Sailor's Guide to Earth\""
summary:       "Sturgill Simpson is a country (psychadelic, outlaw, alt) artist who recently released his third album, 'A Sailor\'s Guide to Earth' -- which penetrates into his recent experience having his first child. The album is fantastic, and in this interview he sits down with the All Songs Considered guys and gets to the core of what inspired the album, some of the production decisions he made, and what fatherhood has been like for him so far. Really great stuff."
