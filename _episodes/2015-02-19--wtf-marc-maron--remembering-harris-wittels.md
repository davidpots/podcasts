podcast:       "WTF with Marc Maron"
title:         "Remembering Harris Wittels"
summary:       "Comedian and writer Harris Wittels passed away on February 19, 2015. This is Marc’s conversation with Harris, originally posted on September 16, 2013. Plenty of casual talk about Harris' relationship to drugs, which is hard not to focus on given his death ~15 months after this was recorded. Otherwise, lots of good talk about Harris' upbringing and intro to comedy. Also, some good music and concert talking – including some great tales of Harris' time following Phish on the road."
