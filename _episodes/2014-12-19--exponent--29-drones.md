podcast:       "Exponent"
title:         "#29: Drones"
summary:       "Ben and James have a thoughtful discussion all about drones. Weighing the perceived problems with them, the question of how to regulate them (if at all), how they could be used for terrorism, and how you balance upside and downside. Fantastic, insightful conversation that feels very prescient."
