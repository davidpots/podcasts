podcast:       "Exponent"
title:         "#37: Apple Watch, Take Two"
summary:       "Of the handful of episodes I listened to discussing the 2015 'Spring Forward' Apple Event (recorded 6 weeks before the Watch's release), this one was the best and most insightful. General discussion around the Apple Watch, including: the wearable market that will be created; how Apple is uniquely positioned (because of fan affinity) to solve the chicken/egg problem with this new market; a well articulated vision of how the Watch might improve daily life a few seconds at a time throughout the course of a day; and general talk of the Watch's role in Apple's product lineup. Also, some chatter about the new single-port MacBook that was just announced."
