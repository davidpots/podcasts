podcast:       "Radiolab"
title:         "The Good Show"
summary:       "This episode (which is one of my all-time Radiolab favorites) explores a question that haunted Charles Darwin: if natural selection boils down to survival of the fittest, how do you explain why one creature might stick its neck out for another? Do we really live in a selfish, dog-eat-dog world? Or has evolution carved out a hidden code that rewards genuine cooperation? Memorable topics include game theory, the prisoner's dilemma, reciprocation in trench warfare, a daring subway rescue, and the extremes of altruism."
