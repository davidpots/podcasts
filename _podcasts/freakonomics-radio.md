title:         "Freakonomics Radio"
description:   "In their books 'Freakonomics,' 'SuperFreakonomics' and 'Think Like a Freak', Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner explore 'the hidden side of everything,' telling stories about cheating schoolteachers and eating champions while teaching us all to think a bit more creatively, rationally, and productively. The Freakonomics Radio podcast, hosted by Dubner, carries on that tradition with weekly episodes. Prepare to be enlightened, engaged, perhaps enraged, and definitely surprised."
