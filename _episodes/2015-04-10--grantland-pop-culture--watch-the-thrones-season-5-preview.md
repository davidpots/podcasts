title:         "Watch the Thrones: Season 5 Preview"
summary:       "On the eve of Game of Thrones' 5th season on HBO, some great discussion from Chris Ryan, Andy Greenwald, Mallory Rubin, and Jason Concepcion about what to expect and look forward to. The hosts do a great job breaking up the interview into three segments: first, some general catchup and anticipation; second, a look at some of the new characters we'll meet in the 5th season of the show; third, a discussion about the book series and how they relate or differ from the show so far. These hosts know their stuff, and the flow of these conversations is pretty great. Entertaining all around."
