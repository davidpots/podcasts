title:         "The Watch is Coming"
summary:       "One the surface, this might seem like just another tech discussion about the Apple Watch – but these guys do a fantastic job getting to the core of how the tech industry often totally misses the point when covering the appeal of Apple products. Focusing on the Watch, they discuss why people buy watches in general; the reason people buy luxury items; how the rest of the watch industry will be effected by Apple’s entry; and so on. This episode features guest Ariel Adams who writes line at ‘A Blog to Watch.’"
