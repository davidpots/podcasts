podcast:       "Invisibilia"
title:         "The Secret History of Thoughts"
summary:       "Co-hosts Alix Spiegel and Lulu Miller ask the question, 'Are my thoughts related to my inner wishes, do they reveal who I really am?'' The answer can have profound consequences for your life. The two main segments look at (1) dark thoughts and our relationship to them; and then (2) a man who was trapped in his body with only his thoughts."

   notes:      "Intro and beginning of the first segment on dark thoughts. A man is suddenly plagued with dark and violent thoughts from which he can't escape -- this segment explores how he dealt with them, with some good insight into mindfulness. Should he confront the thoughts? Counter them? Ignore them? or something else?"
 - time:       "35:02"
   notes:      "Second segment about Martin Pistorius, the 'locked-in man' who for many years was trapped immobile in his body with only his thoughts. A harrowing story about how Martin (who was fully conscious for years, though unable to move) dealt with this, as did his family and caretakers in his life. Oh yeah, and the story of how he finally learned to take back control over his body."
