podcast:       "The Joe Rogan Experience"
title:         "Jay Leno"
summary:       "I was never a fan of either Jay Leno's or David Letterman's late night shows -- they always felt too pedestrian, too obviously watering down their jokes, etc. This interview, though, made me wholly appreciate Jay Leno as a comedian independent of that part of his career. This episode is a nice talk between him and Joe Rogan where Leno talks about coming up as a comedian: challenges, how things have changed, what's stayed the same, and why he keeps himself so busy."
