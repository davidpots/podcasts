podcast:       "Invisibilia"
title:         "Our Computers, Ourselves"
summary:       "A wonderfully crafted episode looking at the ways technology affects our lives. Are computers changing human character? Is our closeness with technology changing us as a species? Some great insight into how our devices can enhance our core human capacities; how society reacts to the introduction of new devices; and how emotions (sadness, anger, happiness) can literally be transfered to others through these tools."
