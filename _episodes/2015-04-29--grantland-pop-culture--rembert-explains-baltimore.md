Guests include: Jamil Smith, Doreen St. Felix, Hillary Crosley Coker, Jamilah Lemieux, and Mychal Denzel Smith. Some of the topics discussed: respectability politics; media reaction; distraction, posturing, and blame; the culture surrounding police brutality; celebrity reactions; and what The Wire has to do (or not) with everything going on."
