podcast:       "Freakonomics Radio"
title:         "Someone Elseâ€™s Acid Trip"
summary:       "Where digital culture and analog living fuse, there is Kevin Kelly: founder of WIRED, publisher of the Whole Earth Catalog, author, and all around rad dude. This is a short, accessible interview with Kelly that I would recommend to anyone. Topics: how Kelly was hired online back in 1983 (!); his take on the story of technology and humankind's relationship to it; living with the minimal amount of technology to get the maximum benefit; and 'the hippie revolution and the computer revolution [being] nearly one and the same.'"
