title:         '#3: The Big Lebowski â€“ "A Life of Achievement"'
summary:       A beautiful discussion of "The Big Lebowski" and everything surrounding it. If you're a fan of the movie, check this out. Featuring hosts Dan Benjamin and Merlin Mann, two podcasting all-stars who are among my favorites, who do this discussion its proper justice. Much anticipated, instant classic.

   notes:      "By all means, start here. General and proper intro about the movie and what set up this specific episode."
 - time:       "4:13"
   notes:      "Good natural jumping in point: Dan and Merlin discuss their respective 'origin story' for Lebowski: how they first came upon it, first reaction, how it grew on them, their relationship with it since, where it stands in the Coen Brothers oeuvre, etc."
