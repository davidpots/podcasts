title:         "Politics of Thrones"
summary:       Insightful look at the politics in George R. R. Martin's "Game of Thrones" series and how they parallel our own post-Cold War landscape. The host speaks with Dan Drezner from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and Tim Westmyer from The Rising Powers Initiative about how Daenerys Targaryen wields her trio of dragons like a nuclear triad, and why King Joffrey was like Kim Jong Un. Struggle for power, what makes a good leader, and what happens to purely (un)-moral characters in a fantasy world that isn't at all black-and-white. Note, this is *generally* spoiler free (aside from the overall plot setup, specific events from later books aren't really covered).
