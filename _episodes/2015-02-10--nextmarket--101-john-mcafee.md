title:         "#101: John McAfee"
summary:       "There may not be a more fascinating person in the world of tech than John McAfee. As the inventor of first antivirus software, McAfee's had a fascinating career that's been periodically interspersed in recent years with international intrigue (he left Belize after what he describes as a 'war with the Belize government') and has had multiple threats on his life in the last few years. He talks about these incidents, but also about his beginnings in programming dating back to the late 60s (punchards! no monitors!), his time in Silicon Valley in the 70s and 80s, and those early days when his antivirus software went viral. We also talk about the future and what McAfee sees as mankind's biggest threat in AI."
