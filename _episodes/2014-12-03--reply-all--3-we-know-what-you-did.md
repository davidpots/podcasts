title:         "#3: We Know What You Did"
summary:       "Twenty years ago, Ethan Zuckerman did something terrible on the internet: he invented what would become the pop-up ad. Today, heâ€™s still living with the consequences. A fascinating recap of how this discovery came about and how it all went wrong. Amongst other things, a nice taste of how the internet used to be (Tripod, Geocities, etc)."
