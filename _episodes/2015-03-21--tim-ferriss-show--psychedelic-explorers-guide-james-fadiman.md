title:         "#66: The Psychedelic Explorer’s Guide with James Fadiman, Ph.D"
summary:       'Jim Fadiman has been called “America’s wisest and most respected authority on psychedelics and their use,” having been involved with psychedelic research since the 1960s. In this episode, him and host Tim Ferriss discuss the immediate and long-term effects of psychedelics when used for spiritual purposes (high dose), therapeutic purposes (moderate dose), and problem-solving purposes (low dose). Fadiman outlines best practices for safe “entheogenic” voyages learned through his more than 40 years of experience–from the benefits of having a sensitive guide during a session (and how to be one) to the importance of the setting and pre-session intention.'
