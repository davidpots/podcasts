title:         "The Calendar"
summary:       "A history of how humans have evolved the design of the calendar as a tool for measuring time. Begins by looking at the Roman calendar, its Julian replacement (following Julius Caesar's hangouts with Cleopatra), the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and failed attempts of recent years to have more sensible calendars implemented across society. Topics include 13 month calendars, adding an extra month, leap years, how to handle holidays, and recent serious efforts to reform calendars from the past 150 years."
