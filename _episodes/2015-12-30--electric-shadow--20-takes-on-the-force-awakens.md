podcast:       "Electric Shadow"
title:         "20 Takes on The Force Awakens"
summary:       "In this episode, host Mois√©s Chiullan reached out to 20 of his film-loving podcasting buddies and collected from each a two-minute take on Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Having listened to 10+ hours of different podcasts talking about this movie, I found the format of this episode to be quite effective in conveying the breadth of different opinions on the film (as well as the areas of shared points-of-view). Good stuff!"
