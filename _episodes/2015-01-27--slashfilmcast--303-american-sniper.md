title:         "#303: American Sniper"
summary:       "A thoughtful discussion around American Sniper: first on the film's effectiveness as a piece of art and entertainment; second on the various political realms the film's reception has spilled into. The hosts of this show do a good job dividing these two areas of discusssion as much as possible. Includes talk about the strengths and weaknesses of Eastwood's directing style; similarities (and differences) between the reception to this film compared to 'Lone Survivor' and 'Zero Dark Thirty'; what happens when one's criticism of art is equated with one's political beliefs; and so on."
