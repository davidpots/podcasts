   notes:      "Great discussion about marijuana legalization in the USA, and the strange new legal world this introduces in some respects. States rights vs. Federal law, neighbor states filing lawsuits (and why the Supreme Court may or may not act on this), the impediments to legalization taking hold, intolerable oppression limits on both sides, and the genie being out of the bottle."
