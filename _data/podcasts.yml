  description:   "Tim Ferriss is a self-experimenter and bestselling author, best known for The 4-Hour Workweek, which has been translated into 40+ languages. Newsweek calls him 'the world's best human guinea pig,' and The New York Times calls him 'a cross between Jack Welch and a Buddhist monk.' In this show, he deconstructs world-class performers from eclectic areas (investing, chess, pro sports, etc.), digging deep to find the tools, tactics, and tricks that listeners can use."

- title:         "Warrior Poet Project"
  description:   "The Warrior Poet Project Podcast is not about the creator Aubrey Marcus, but rather about an idea. The idea of bringing balance back into a world that is increasingly polarized, and a sense of tribe back to a people growing increasingly solipsistic. True to the concept this channel blends humor with gravity and levity with depth, as we explore the realms of the mind, psychedelics, athletics, MMA and Sexuality. Buckle up and enjoy the ride! Be sure to check out host Aubrey Marcus on the Joe Rogan Experience Podcast and follow him on twitter @WarriorPoetUS."
