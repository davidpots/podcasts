podcast:       "Reconcilable Differences"
title:         "#1: We All Ruined It Together"
summary:       "In this inaugural episode, John Siracusa and Merlin Mann (two of my favorite podcasting and internet humans) begin framing the conversation on exactly how they got how they are. From the dungeons of Usenet to the dragons of roving bullies â€“ origins are explored, awkwardness is catalogued, and differences are provisionally reconciled. Good talk from beginning to end; gets me very excited for this podcast."
