podcast:       "Buddhist Geeks"
title:         "Buddhism, Science, and Scientism"
summary:       "In this keynote from the 2014 Buddhist Geeks Conference, Dr. Charles T. Tart addresses the convergence of spirituality, science, and scientism. Out of the gate, he covers some important differences between science and scientism -- and how a blind adherence to the latter can in fact hurt our collective ability to grow and adapt going forward. He also summarizes the collective body of research that supports the serious consideration of various paranormal topics: ESP, remote viewing, reincarnation, out of body & near death experiences, and so on. An insightful lecture, given Tart's very level-headed approach to potentially loaded topics. Dr. Tart has been involved with research and theory in the fields of Hypnosis, Psychology, Transpersonal Psychology, Parapsychology, Consciousness and Mindfulness since 1963."
