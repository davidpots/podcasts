   notes:      "Terrific summary of the different eras of SNL since it came on the air: from John Belushi / Dan Aykroyd / Bill Murray, to Eddie Murphy / Dana Carvey / Phil Artman / Mike Meyers, to Adam Sandler / Will Ferrell / Norm Macdonald, to Tina Fey / Amy Poehler / Seth Myers / Bill Hader, and into the current cast. Gives a really good overview of the immense talent the show has seen, and paints in broad strokes how the cliques have transitioned from one age to another."
