podcast:       "The Tim Ferriss Show"
title:         "Chris Sacca on Being Different and Making Billions"
summary:       "In this episode, Tim Ferriss has a great conversation with his good friend Chris Sacca. Sacca is a newly minted billionaire who focuses on early-stage investments in companies like Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Kickstarter, and many more. In this talk, Ferriss and Sacca discuss unfair advantages, how Chris chooses founders and investments, stories of missed opportunities, the styles that differentiate Wall Street from Silicon Valley investors, and how keg parties can liberate law students from the tyranny of class (Chris completed law school without attending any classes). If you haven't heard Sacca's first apperance on This Week in Startups (with host Jason Calacanis), that is also an absolute must listen -- he goes into his incredible origin story which he only skims the surface of here."
