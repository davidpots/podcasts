title:         "#77: Dazed and Confused"
summary:       "A conversational journey back in time to Austin, 1976 to talk about Richard Linklater's film Dazed and Confused. Quentin Tarantino called it one of the best films of the 90's. For many fans, Dazed and Confused represents Texan director Richard Linklater's mainstream cinema debut and a launching pad for fellow Texan and Academy Award Winner Matthew McConaugheyâ€™s film career. But this movie tells a wonderful personal story of youth in Texas. Recommended episode by all means."
