podcast:       "The Incomparable"
title:         "#233: Selective Amnesia"
summary:       "Some solid comic book nerdery is in full effect in this episode. This discussion goes far beyond the details of any specific comic, instead taking the chatter to a higher level that applies to the plight of any comic-book reader. Topics include comic book continuity and the storytelling ramifications at stake (being bound to prior events, or being free to forget and rewrite history); the business decisions made by publishers (marketing students, crossovers, etc) used to sell comics; and the management of comics intellectual property in this modern age where TV and film considerations can't be ignored. Panel members share highs and lows of their comic book fandom with regard to being won over, or feeling swindled, by some of these storytelling and publishing decisions."
