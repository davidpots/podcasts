podcast:       "Nerdist"
title:         "Robert Rodriguez"
summary:       "Here's a great conversation with filmmaker Robert Rodriguez (El Mariachi, Sin City, Spy Kids, and the new TV network 'El Rey'). Rodriguez's career is a noteworthy one because of his irreverence: he has frequently eschewed many of the conventional filmmaking production processes that add unnecessary cost and complexity. By keeping costs and budgets very low, he maintains a sense of freedom and independence that isn't ordinary. The conversation includes talk of the importance of action before inspiration, the importance of constraints, his friendship with Tarantino in the early '90s, and much more."
