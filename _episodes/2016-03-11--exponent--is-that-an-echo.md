podcast:       "Exponent"
title:         "Is that an Echo?"
summary:       "Ben and James discuss the Amazon Echo, Apple’s cloudy future, Google’s Missed Opportunity, and why Amazon has so much growth potential ahead of it. Some great insight into the Echo being the first big 'ecosystem' product released in a long time that does NOT involve a smartphone. Likewise, exploring Microsoft's inability to imagine a world where PCs weren't the hub; and the similar inability of Google/Apple to imagine a world where smartphones aren't the hub."
