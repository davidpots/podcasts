title:         The Story Behind Mark Ronson's Hit Song "Uptown Funk"
summary:       A conversation with Mark Ronson -- accomplished DJ, producer, and musician -- who has most recently been in the spotlight for his song "Uptown Funk" featuring Bruno Mars (which just ended a 14-week run at number 1 on the Billboard charts). Ronson talks about the long and sometimes arduous process of recording "Uptown Funk"; his work with Amy Winehouse on the "Back to Black" album; growing up in New York City in the late 80s and what his influences were; how he got his start as a DJ and eventually a producer; and what it was like to grow up with his stepfather Nick Jones (cofounder and guitarist for Foreigner), and so on.
