title:         "All Songs +1: 'Baltimore'"
summary:       Following the week of unrest in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, the folks at All Songs Considered had asked listeners for songs they'd been turned on to in the past week. The song mentioned most was Randy Newman's "Baltimore" -- or more specifically, Nina Simone's cover from 1978. This episode is a quick look at the song and why it resonates so powerfully nearly 40 years after Randy Newman first wrote it. This is a short but poignant episode where the hosts introduce the song, the context around it, and let the music stand on its own.
