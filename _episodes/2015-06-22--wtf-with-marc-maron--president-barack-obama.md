podcast:       "WTF with Marc Maron"
title:         "#63: President Barack Obama"
summary:       "A fantastic, down-to-earth and no-nonsense conversation between Marc Maron and Barack Obama. The human experience of what it's like being president, including: college, fitting in, race relations, gun violence, changing the status quo, disappointing your fans, comedians, fatherhood and overcoming fear. This episode gets at the heart of what I love most about podcasting: cutting through the pretense and the crap; letting the core of the conversation shine through."
