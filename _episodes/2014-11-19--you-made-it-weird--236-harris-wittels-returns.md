title:         "#236: Harris Wittels Returns"
summary:       "Harris Wittels returns to chat with Pete about death, drugs, coping, and the future. A somewhat prescient conversation, given Harris' death 15 months after this was recorded. Harris talks about what was going on in his life as his addictions took firmer hold over him and describes bumping up against rock bottom a few times. Some great stories about trying to make it work with his Scientologist girlfriend and some epic quests finding drugs in LA's MacAurthor Park. Altogether, a terrific (and sad, in retrospect) conversation."
